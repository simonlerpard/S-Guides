#description: "A basic tutorial on how to connect and visualize Martin M-PC lightshow with MA3D using grandMA2 and The ArtNetominator. This tutorial is useful if you like to program in Martin M-PC instead of grandMA2, but you like free good programs like MA3D to visualize and prepare the lightshow. I will not write a complete guide, so please check out the video and feel free to comment and ask questions."

This video describes on how to fix a pan/tilt bug in MA2 when artnet is used from Martin M-PC.
If you watched my other video on how to visualize your Martin M-PC lightshow in MA3D youâ€™ll probably come across this Pan and Tilt problem/bug.


Just follow these steps, and you will be good to go:

1. Set the Pan and the Tilt in M-PC to 0% (both of them)
2. Go over to grandMA2 and select your fixtures
3. Go to the Positions tab (in MA2) and set both pan and tilt to 0% (min)
4. Clear the programmer in MA2!
5. Save the showfile in MA2 and then you are good to go :)
