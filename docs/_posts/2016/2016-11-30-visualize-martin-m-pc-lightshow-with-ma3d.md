#description: "A basic tutorial on how to connect and visualize Martin M-PC lightshow with MA3D using grandMA2 and The ArtNetominator. This tutorial is useful if you like to program in Martin M-PC instead of grandMA2, but you like free good programs like MA3D to visualize and prepare the lightshow. I will not write a complete guide, so please check out the video and feel free to comment and ask questions."

A basic tutorial on how to connect and visualize Martin M-PC lightshow with MA3D using grandMA2 and The ArtNetominator. This tutorial is useful if you like to program in Martin M-PC instead of grandMA2, but you like free good programs like MA3D to visualize and prepare the lightshow. I will not write a complete guide, so please check out the video and feel free to comment and ask questions.

**NOTE:** Martin M-PC has been discontinued. The new name for the same thing is Onyx and can be found at Obsidian Control System.

This guide is inspired from [Martin MPC with MA3D](https://imgur.com/a/PRUDt). Thanks to [UserUkn0w](https://imgur.com/user/UserUkn0w)!

**Edit**: I also discovered a Pan/Tilt bug in this kind of setup. I made a video of that too, so [please visit this post](/pt-bug-in-ma2-when-using-artnet-from-m-pc) when you’ve watched the entire video.
