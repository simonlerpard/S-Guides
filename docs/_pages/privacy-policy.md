#### Who we are / who am I?
Simons' Guides is created by Simon Lerpard, [read more](/about). From here on I'm going to refer to *me* as *we*

#### What personal data we collect and why we collect it
**TLDR;** We don't but we are using other 3rd party services such as [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) and [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).

##### Comments
When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor’s IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection.

An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

We are using a third party commenting system named Disqus. You can read more about their [privacy policy](https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy) and their [data sharing policy](https://disqus.com/data-sharing-settings/) on their website.
